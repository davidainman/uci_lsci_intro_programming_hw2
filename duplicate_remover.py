# duplicates of numbers that have occurred earlier in the
# list, preserving the order otherwise
# 
# For the example below, the output should be
# "[1, 4, 3, 2, 5, 7, 9]"
# 
# Note that I have put duplicates_list into the function
# as an argument. We will discuss this syntax later. For now,
# it is a way for me to test your code using different lists.
# If you want to test your code with different list inputs,
# simply change the default duplicates_list variable below
