# Write code that calculates the sum of the square of every even 
# number in the list below and prints it (that is, you take each 
# even number, square it, and then add them all together).
# 
# You can use a list comprehension or a regular loop. You can also
# use the sum function to sum the values in a list if it's helpful.
# sum(<list>)
# 
# For the list below, your code should print 44984
#
# Note that I have put the numbers list into the function
# as an argument. We will discuss this syntax later. For now,
# it is a way for me to test your code using different lists.
# If you want to test your code with different list inputs,
# simply change the default numbers variable below
